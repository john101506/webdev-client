          This is a paragraph. We often separate a long set of sentences with
          vertical spaces to make the text easier to read. Browsers ignore
          vertical white spaces and render all the text as one single set of
          sentences. To force the browser to add vertical spacing, wrap the
          paragraphs you want to separate with the paragraph tag
        </p>
        <p id="wd-p-2">
          This is the first paragraph. The paragraph tag is used to format
          vertical gaps between long pieces of text like this one.
        </p>
        <p id="wd-p-3">
          This is the second paragraph. Even though there is a deliberate white
          gap between the paragraph above and this paragraph, by default
          browsers render them as one contiguous piece of text as shown here on
          the right.
        </p>
        <p id="wd-p-4">
          This is the third paragraph. Wrap each paragraph with the paragraph
          tag to tell browsers to render the gaps.
        </p>
        <p id="wd-ai-p">
          Wrapping text in a &lt;p&gt; tag creates vertical spacing because
          browsers render paragraphs as block-level elements with default top
          and bottom margins. Each paragraph starts on its own line and is
          separated from its neighbors by that margin.
